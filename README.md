## Games Search - iOS App

**Development Overview** -> *Native iOS App â€“ Swift, SwiftUI*

This project was a personal exercise to consume a public api that has a sizeable database to query.

I've also implemented a form of pagination, so each swipe down action queries more results.

The api's information is:

I've captured a quick video that shows the app in action. Enjoy!
